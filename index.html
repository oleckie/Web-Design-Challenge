    <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X
    </h1>

    <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes depending on how far or how close we are from the equator. As a starting point, I used OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data from over 500 cities worldwide.
        
        After creating the dataset, I used Matplolib to plot various aspects of weather vs. latitude. Some of the aspects of weather that were used in the comparison were: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. Within this site you will find the source data used and the visualizations developed for the analysis.
